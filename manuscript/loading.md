## How do I get programs into my Nintendo DS?

### The Methods

There are a few ways of getting your code into the Nintendo DS. The first of
which is the simple GBA flash cart. These flash carts are generally quite
expensive, have a low availability, and don’t hold very much memory. They fit
into the phat Nintendo DS systems perfectly and do not stick out from the
bottom, except on the Nintendo DS Lite, as other things do. The second way of
running code is on a removable memory device. These kinds of devices come in
two flavors: Slot-1 and Slot-2. Slot-2 devices, such as the M3 Adapter, G6
Flash, NeoFlash, SuperCard, and the GBA Movie Player, generally support both
Nintendo DS and GBA software. Slot-1 devices, such as the M3 Simply, R4DS, M3
Real, DS-X, NinjaDS, and the Cyclo DS Evolution, generally only support
Nintendo DS software. Slot-1 devices also fit into the Nintendo DS perfectly.
The first four of those Slot-2 devices are produced by supporters of piracy and
should be avoided. It is recommended to use the GBA Movie Player (GBAMP) if you
want to use a Slot-2 device. With Slot-1 devices, we don't have too much of a
choice but to choose the lesser of many evils.

### Which Slot-1 Device should I buy?

As there are no homebrew produced devices made by homebrew people for homebrew
people (yet), we regretfully have to buy devices designed and sold for piracy
when buying NoPass or Slot-1 devices. That said, the most important feature to
consider when buying one of these devices is DLDI support.

### What is DLDI?

DLDI stands for dynamically linked device interface. In order for the homebrew
filesystem, known as libfat, to work, you'll need a device which supports the
DLDI standard. DLDI specifies a system by which DLDI modules can be dynamically
loaded into homebrew software. This allows developers to release one version of
their homebrew which the software end users simply patch and then run on a
device of their choice. If you buy a device that does not support DLDI, you
will be out of luck when wanted to run a majority of the homebrew applications
and games out there. Not to mention that the company producing the device is
essentially saying, "We don't need to spend time catering to the homebrew
community since our device is designed just for piracy." We'd be better off not
supporting that kind of company with our business.

You can learn more about DLDI and how to use it at the DLDI Wiki website,

### So, which Slot-1 devices are good?

There are so many Slot-1 devices on the market today. Choosing one of them has
become very difficult, as the choices are so many. In this manual, I'll discuss
the devices I'm familiar with, which nifty features they purport, and how they
compare to one another.

### R4DS

This device is built well. It is the most sturdy of the three. It uses microSD
cards for storage and supports DLDI. This means that you can run homebrew
software and use the microSD card's filesystem. With the most recent firmware,
it can even automatically patch generic DLDI homebrew software with the proper
DLDI driver for the R4DS on the fly. This means that you don't have to use your
PC to patch your homebrew software before placing it onto your microSD card.
The R4DS cannot use microSDHC cards, however. Some people have complained about
the spring loaded microSD slot, so the makers of R4DS have removed it from
current models. The R4DS is a great device overall and well supported by the
Nintendo DS homebrew community, but it does not support running GBA software
unfortunately.

### M3 Real

This device comes in varying configurations for your various needs. It comes
with both a Slot-1 device and a Slot-2 device. The Slot-2 device is what
differs between the three M3 Real configurations. In the first and cheapest
configuration, the Slot-2 pack is simply a rumble pack. In the second and more
expensive version, the Slot-2 pack is a dual rumble and RAM pack. This
configuration will also run GBA homebrew. The flash cart size is kept secret by
M3, for some reason. Natrium42 was kind enough to inform me that, after doing a
few tests on the pack, that it is at least 8MB in size, but lacks SRAM. The
third and most expensive configuration, dubbed the "GBA Expansion Package",
provides a Slot-2 pack with rumble, SRAM, and 32MB of RAM. <!-- XXX verify this
information with Natrium42 -->

The M3 Real supports DLDI as well. I'm not sure if it can automatically patch
homebrew with its own driver on the fly, however. The homebrew software may
need to be patched on a PC before being transferred to the SD card.

The M3 Real supports microSD and microSDHC cards, unlike the R4DS. So if you
are in the mood for massive storage, the M3 Real can be your friend.

### Cyclo DS Evolution

This device has very recently come to market, but is already making a big
impression in the community. The Cyclo DS Evolution has the best looking and
functioning menu system of the three devices, in my opinion. And if you don't
like it, the menus are skinnable with a number of skins already available for
the device. You might be thinking, "Why would I care what my menus look or act
like?" Well, when you use the device to load your software over and over and
over again, bad menus really piss you off. When you can't use the touch screen
to scroll up and down and select items and have to use the keys, but holding
down the keys doesn't make the menu scroll by and you have to press the up and
down buttons a lot to get to your software, you get pissed off. And yes, there
really are menus that are this bad.

Aside from the pleasant menus, the Cyclo DS Evolution supports DLDI. It also
features on the fly DLDI patching. I dislike having to patch my games on my PC
before loading them onto my microSD card, so this is a great feature.

My favorite feature of the Cyclo DS Evolution is the "remember what I loaded
last time and load that same program again" feature. Simply holding down L and
R at boot will boot the last thing that was booted. This enables me to avoid
navigating the menu system when I'm debugging a program and running it
repeatedly for testing.

The Cyclo DS Evolution also has a NoPass mode where it will act as a NoPass to
boot your GBA flash carts, a GBA Movie Player, or any other Slot-2 device.

As you've probably noticed, as I've written the most about the Cyclo DS
Evolution, that I like it the best of the three devices. It is competitively
priced with the others, which is good. While it doesn't support running GBA
software, it feature rich on the Nintendo DS side of things. I recommend the
Cyclo DS Evlolution to meet all of your Slot-1 needs and desires.

### Where do I get one of these Slot-1 devices?</title>

Out of the many places to buy these devices, I've been most happy with
electrobee. electrobee is run by a trusted member of the homebrew community and
ships worldwide from good ol' Canada (as opposed to who knows where). Their
prices are quite often the best, too. When you are ready to purchase a Slot-1
device, I recommend that you visit
[electrobee.com](http://electrobee.com/index.php?ref=16)>.

### The Slot-2 Device of Choice

If you decide that GBA software development is important for you, you might
want to consider getting a NoPass and a Slot-2 device. The NoPass will allow
you to run Nintendo DS software from your Slot-2 device. The Slot-2 device, on
its own, will be able to run GBA software. If you only care about Nintendo DS
software, a Slot-1 device will meet your needs well.

The GBA Movie Player is a wonderful device which can run your software from a
Compact Flash card. Compact Flash cards are very cheap and in high supply. If
you have more SD cards than CF cards around, unfortunately, the only way to run
NDS software from an SD card at this time is with the SD versions of the
SuperCard or M3 Adapter. The GBAMP also sticks out from the bottom of the
Nintendo DS a little, as shown in [Figure 3.1, “Comparison of GBAMP (left) and
a GBA flash cart (right) inserted into a DS”](#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart).

With the GBA flash cart, the process of loading your programs into memory is a
bit slow. Also, each GBA flash cart writer is specific to certain carts and
often have closed source drivers. This means that most flash carts will be
incompatible with Linux or Macintosh computers. In actuality, the only good
thing about a GBA flash cart is that it does not stick out from the Nintendo
DS, as can be seen in [Figure 3.1, “Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash
cart (right) inserted into a DS”](#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart).


### Running Multiple Software Titles

If you chose to go with the GBA flash cart, you can use a utility called
Darkain’s MultiNDS Loader to load multiple programs onto your flash cart. This
way, you don’t have to re-flash your cart each time you want to run a different
application.

If you chose to go with the GBAMP, then I’d highly recommend DragonMinded's
DSOrganize. It supports booting multiple programs, text editing, address books,
calendars, and more. It's a great application for the DS. You can get it from
<http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize>. However, you cannot use a
stock GBAMP to run NDS programs. You have to flash it with some custom
firmware. Instructions and firmware are available from
<http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html>.

As for Slot-1 devices, these all usually come with their own menu systems
(often incorrectly referred to as operating systems). You won't have to do
anything special to run multiple software titles.
