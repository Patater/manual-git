# Chapter 6
## What is a sprite? How do I use them?

### Magical Fairies?

No, sprites are not magical fairies. It is a term in 2D graphics programming
which refers to an image or animation. The Nintendo DS has dedicated hardware
for dealing with sprites. This makes the system very useful for 2D. Most gaming
systems do not have a 2D core, and all sprites and other 2D graphics have to be
handled manually by painting 2D images on the side of a quad within 3D space.

### The OAM

The OAM manages all the sprites. This is an immense job, most of it done behind
the scenes for us. After using it, you might think it magical. It's not as
magical as it seems, however. OAM stands for Object Attribute Memory. It is the
place in memory we use to keep track of and control our sprites. The OAM works
with a `SpriteEntry` and a `SpriteRotation` struct to manage the attributes of
our sprites.

### Information About the Sprite Hardware

On the Nintendo DS, we can have up to 128 sprites. Only 32 of those sprites can
be affine transformed (rotated, scaled, skewed, etc.). We are also only allowed
to address 1024 different tiles to comprise all of our sprites, per engine.
Sprites can be made of tiles that use 16 colors or of ones that use 256 colors.
Tiles that use 256 colors are twice as large as tiles that use only 16 colors.
Another advantage of using 16-color sprites is the ability to use 16 different
palettes. When using 256-color sprites, each sprite (and tile) must use the
same palette. When using 16-color sprites, we can have one sprite use one
16-color palette and another sprite use a different 16-color palette, even
though both use the same tile data. Games often use this trick to make
different colored enemies that look the same. The sprites still use the same
tile data, but they use different palettes.

### How Sprites are Stored in Memory

Sprites are broken into 8x8 pixel pieces. This is called tiling. When drawn to
screen, the hardware pieces these tiles together, like a puzzle where the
pieces have no distinguishing edges. There are two ways to tile sprites, 1D and
2D. In a 2D layout, the sprite memory is treated like a giant image from which
sprite tiles are obtained by making a box the size of the sprite and placing it
over the giant image. In a 1D layout, the sprites are laid out in a linear
fashion, as discussed in [Figure 6.1](#sprite_tile_layout).

The conversion process is very similar to that for backgrounds. We simple make
grit rule files that tell grit how we want our images converted, and it
generates a .o and a header file for us. The grit rule files and image files go
into the same place as background images, the `gfx` folder.

### Sprite Attributes

Sprites have three attribute variables associated with them. With them, sprites
can spin and flip and mosaic and perform all sorts of fun hardware effects.
Each attribute is multi-purpose and requires some amount of bit twiddling and
masking to achieve the affects we want. That is, it would if it weren't for
this nice `SpriteEntry` union which libnds provides for us. In most cases, we
will use this union to do what we'd like to with our sprites, but there are
special cases where this is not possible.

We will cover how to update, initialize, and rotate using bit twiddling
methods, as libnds doesn't yet provide ways of doing this otherwise. libnds
provides the means to do other things that we'll be doing with sprites though,
like move them, we'll be doing. We'll use the libnds API wherever possible.
Let's write some functions to do each of those, in that order.

I provide you with a header file, located with the accompanying source at
`code/chapter_6-sprites/include/sprites.h` that contains a collection of sprite
related function declarations. We'll be working on the definitions for each of
these functions together in a new file called `sprites.cpp`. Our first step
will be to create a that new source code file. Put a new file called
`sprites.cpp` into the `source` folder of your project directory.

### Updating the OAM

Instead of keeping track of things directly in the OAM, we'll manage a copy of
the OAM in memory that we will copy over every frame using `updateOAM()`. The
reason we do this is because writes to OAM are locked during all times but
during VBlank. We will wait for VBlank to occur before copying our copy of the
OAM into the actually OAM.

Updating the OAM is very straightforward. We do this by copying our copy of the
OAM to the real OAM. Our copy of the OAM might still be stuck in the cache and
may not have made it into main memory yet, so we first flush local memory (a
must whenever performing a DMA operation) to ensure that DMA sees the correct
data. The data we want to copy might be stuck in cache still and may not have
made it into main memory yet. Then, we tell the OAM to look into the `OAMTable`
instance we will create later for information about each one of our sprites.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:update_oam}}
```

### Initializing the OAM

The first thing we do when initializing the OAM is to clear all the sprite data
in the OAM. After that, we'll make a call to our afore written `updateOAM()`
function.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:init_oam}}
```

### Rotating Sprites

Let's get to spinning. This is a bit more difficult than what we've done
before, but still fun. It's nice to not have to make a separate sprite for each
rotation position the sprite will be presented in. However, doing so may be
necessary for some applications as the Nintendo DS rotation won't always look
as pretty as if the rotations had been done elsewhere.

The libnds's sin and cos lookup tables employ a 32768 degree system. Humans
usually use a 360 degree system or radians. The angle we'll work with in this
function will be one that is part of the 32768 degree system. You'll have to
convert your radians or weird 360 degree value (Seriously, why 360? Silly
Babylonians.) to the 32768 degree system before using this function in order to
see the results you are expecting.

We have to use a transformation derived from our time spent playing with an
affine transformation matrix. The sprite's affine transformation matrix is used
slightly differently from the background affine transformation matrix. If you
have a background in linear algebra, I'd recommend reading up on this portion
of the hardware at <https://gbadev.net/tonc/affine.html>.

<a name="libnds_affine_sprite"></a>

#### Figure 6.2. libnds Affine Sprite API

\begin{bmatrix}HDX & HDY\\\\VDX & VDY\end{bmatrix}

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:rotate_sprite}}
```

### Showing and Hiding Sprites

Up until now, we haven't used the fancy `SpriteEntry` union included in libnds.
It allows us to avoid thinking about bit twiddling and masking in most cases.
In the case of showing and hiding sprites, we still need to be thinking about
these bits due to an oddity in the Nintendo DS hardware: the hiding bit of a
sprite (bit 9 of sprite attribute 0) is also the double bound bit of a sprite
if the sprite is an affine sprite (bit 8 of sprite attribute 0). Follow along
with the comments and code as we formulate a solution to writing a function
which shows and hides all kinds of sprites.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:sprite_visibility}}
```

### Moving Sprites

Now for some real fun. Moving sprites in hardware, and not having to worry
about clipping, buffers, or anything, is such a wonderful feeling. To move a
sprite, we simply change the `SpriteEntry` properties `x` and `y`. This is a
case where we don't have to think much about the underlying arrangement of this
information. The libnds union `SpriteEntry` describes the organization of data
to the compiler for us and the compiler then figures out the best way to
operate on that data; the compiler does the bit twiddling and masking for us.
Since this is so simple, we don't even need to write a function to do it for
us. So just take note of what we do here and remember it for later; you don't
have to write a function for it, but if you want to I'd recommend making it an
inline function.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:moving_sprites}}
```

### Setting Sprite Priorities

The ability to set a sprites priority is essential when dealing with multiple
sprites, as we will be doing. As such, we'll now discuss sprite priorities and
how to set them.

A sprite, like a background, has a priority which determines how the sprite will
appear with respect to other sprites and to backgrounds. A sprite with the same
number priority as a background will appear above it. A sprite with a lower
priority number than another sprite will appear above that other sprite. There
are four priorities per graphics engine available for sprites, similar to
background priorities.

To set the sprite priority, we'll simply set the `SpriteEntry` property
`priority` to one of four different values, depending on which priority we wish
to assign: `OBJPRIORITY_0`, `OBJPRIORITY_1`, `OBJPRIORITY_2`, or
`OBJPRIORITY_3`. The following code listing shows an example of what this looks
like.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:setting_priority}}
```

### Using the Sprites

Now that our `sprites.cpp` file is finished, let's get on to how sprites are
stored in memory, how to load them, and so forth. So put away your sprites.cpp
file into the source directory of your home folder and let's get back into our
`main.cpp` file.

### Setting up VRAM for Sprites

We'll need to make a place for our sprite data to live in VRAM. Since we will
be using sprites on the main graphics engine, we can use VRAM bank E for our
sprites. VRAM bank E is smaller than the other VRAM banks we've dealt with so
far, as it is only 64 KB in size. However, this is more than enough to store
1024 unique 16-color tiles.

In our `initVideo()`, we need to map VRAM bank E for use with sprites on the
main graphics engine. Then, we need to tell the main engine to enable sprites
of the tiling style we want. We will use 1D tiled sprites. The resulting
initVideo function, post-modifications, is presented below <!-- XXX do a link
thingy to the code listing-->.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:init_video}}
```

### Sprite Tile Addressing

We'll be using the same memory alignment (boundary) as the GBA uses for our
sprites. Tile VRAM addresses must be aligned to 32 bytes. If you feel shorted
by this, since you can't use all 1024 addressable tiles when using 256 color
tiles, for instance, then you can look up how to use other alignments at
<https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs>. You'll have to set
`REG_DISPCNT` (via `videoSetMode()`) with a value defined in
`libnds/include/nds/arm9/video.h` akin to `DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_XXX` (the
default, and the method the GBA and we use, is `DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_32`).

To compute the address to copy tiles to, we basically need to know two things:
the memory alignment we are using and the tile numbers we want to assign data
to. Using the formula from Martin Korth's GBATEK, "TileVramAddress =
TileNumber * BoundaryValue", and libnds's `SPRITE_GFX` define we can compute
the address of any tile as follows.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:tile_computation}}
```

We usually want to copy more than one tile into VRAM at a time, however.
Luckily, when converting images to sprites with grit, it will tell us the
length in bytes of our tile data for that sprite. After we have the length in
bytes, we can use `dmaCopyHalfwords()` (which uses byte lengths for copying) to
copy the tile data into VRAM. We can also calculate how many tiles an image
uses from its length in bytes by diving the length in bytes by how many bytes a
tile takes up. In our case, as we'll be using 16-color tiles, a tile (8x8
pixels) takes up 32 bytes.

### Loading in a Sprite

Now, to see a sprite in action. Let's load in the `orangeShuttle` graphic and
the moon graphic. Make a new function called `initSprites()`. Place it after
the `initBackgrounds()` function. Make sure to include `orangeShuttle.h` and
`moon.h` now. They contain information about our sprites as generated by grit.

I've also create a new struct type called `SpriteInfo`. This struct contains
information about sprites that aren't explicitly contained in the `SpriteEntry`
struct. We'll be using it to help us manage our information about sprites
better.

#### Procedure 6.1. To Create a Sprite

1. We'll begin by filling in our `SpriteInfo` struct for the sprite. Each
   sprite will have its own `SpriteInfo` struct. The first thing we need to do
   is assign an OAM ID to the sprite. This number will help us keep track of
   which OAM entry our sprite is associated with. We'll also use it to compute
   other offsets, although we don't have to use it for that purpose in many
   cases.
1. Assign the width, height, and angle of the sprite.
1. Select an OAM entry to associate with this sprite.
1. Configure attribute 0.
1. Configure attribute 1.
1. Configure attribute 2.
1. Copy tile data to VRAM.
1. Copy the palette data to VRAM.

We'll just follow these steps twice when writing the `initSprites()` function
for our sprites. You can follow along with the comments and the code below.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:init_sprites}}
```

### What are assertions?

In the above code, you'll find some things that look like function calls to a
function called `assert()`. These aren't actually function calls, but macro
expansions. You'll have to include `assert.h` in order to use them.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:assert}}
```

The assert macro allows the programmer to make assumptions about what is going
on in the code. To use them, you just place some kind of "fact" in between the
parenthesis. Whenever this assumption fails, the program will quit. Assertions
are evaluated at run time.

Assertions help you avoid developing obscure bugs later on since they'll stop
them right where something first goes wrong. Assertions are a good thing and
should be used often.

When you release a production version of your software, the assertions can be
removed from your code by the preprocessor. To do this with a GNU compiler,
like the ones we are using, you simply set `NDEBUG`.

Remember to never use assertions for errors that can realistically happen at
runtime. For example, it is okay to assert that one define is never bigger than
a different define because it's all evaluated at compile time. It's impossible
that this changes after the code has been compiled, so it is impossible that an
end-user of your program will ever find a problem that you haven't seen during
testing.

However, you should never check that `malloc()` or `fopen()` return a valid
pointer with `assert()` because it's not guaranteed that they will always do
what you want them to do. It's possible that your game runs out of RAM because
the end-user plays in a different way than you during your tests, or that a file
can't be found because the SD card of the end-user is faulty! Your code needs to
be able to handle that kind of failures.

### Displaying the Sprites

In our main function, we now need to initialize our copy of the OAM, create the
structs which hold our sprite data, make a call to the `initSprites()` function
we just created, and then update the OAM by copying our OAM copy to OAM.

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:main}}
```

### Compiling

Before you get to compiling, you may want to look at the top of your `main.cpp`
file and verify that you are including all the proper files. There are a lot of
files to include now, so it is easy to lose track of which ones we need. (I
probably even forgot to let you know about some of them.)

```C++
{{#include snippets/sprites/1/main.cpp:headers}}
```

If all goes well, you’ll compile with no problems and the output will look as
in [Figure 6.3, “Output with both backgrounds and a
sprite”](#chapter_6_screen_shot).
