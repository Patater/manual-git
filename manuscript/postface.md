I hope you've enjoyed reading this manual as much as I've enjoyed writing it. I
hope it has helped you to learn the basics of Nintendo DS programming, and if
not, that it has pointed you in the correct direction. I wish you luck in all
your future projects and endeavors.

Feel free to contact me <jaeden@patater.com>, if you need any help or have
corrections or suggestions.
