        You love playing games on your Nintendo DS. Every game you've played
        has been a wonderful experience, each one leaving a lovely aftertaste
        on your gaming tongue. You may have wondered to yourself what it'd be
        like to create games, to offer your own software up for licking. You've
        drawn diagrams of games you'd love to make, worlds you want to share
        with others. But how to go about it? You think and are lost: you are
        stuck. Where do I start? Whats going on inside that pretty little
        dual-screen box?
      </p><p>
        This manual is designed to help you get an idea of whats going on
        inside the Nintendo DS. With a bit of effort and time, you'll be on
        your way to creating your own games. Join us, the homebrew community.
        You'll have a great time giving others a great time, collaborating on
        projects, and feeling the rush of intense and under pressure coding for
        numerous programming competitions.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm73"></a>The Solution</h2></div></div></div><p>
        This manual is the start of the solution. In it, I will cover the
        basics of programming the Nintendo DS starting with an explanation of
        the politics behind the homebrew movement and through the emergence of
        passthrough devices, how to choose between a Slot-1 device or a Slot-2
        device, , how to choose a passthrough device, setting up the
        programming environment, displaying backgrounds, using sprites, and
        basic game programming techniques. All these things will be discussed
        in the context of the creation of a simple game I concocted one weekend
        entitled "Orange Spaceship."
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm76"></a>How to Use this Manual</h2></div></div></div><p>
        I assume you know a bit of C or C++ coding. If not, spend at least 20
        hours making a variety of programs on your own in addition to
        completing some tutorials. It doesn't matter what you write, so long as
        you make sure you have a solid understanding of structs, classes, the
        heap, loops, bitwise and logical operators. I recommend the following
        tutorial and reference as a great place to get started learning, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" target="_top">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cppreference.com/" target="_top">http://www.cppreference.com/</a>.
      </p><p>
        Next, just read through the chapters one by one, making sure you
        understand the current chapter before moving to the next. Code listings
        will be on a gray background. Follow along with the code listings,
        writing your own code based on the listings.

        Since the Nintendo DS debut, Nintendo enthusiasts ranging from
        pre-pubescent kids to 30-year-old college dropouts have been wanting to
        develop their own games and applications for the Nintendo DS. Nintendo
        has stated that the DS stands for "Developer's System". For those
        worthy enough to land a nice developing contract with Nintendo, it
        truly is. However, most people will never receive this contract,
        special permission from Nintendo to commercially produce games for the
        Nintendo DS. In order to obtain a contract with Nintendo, you must
        prove your worthiness by showcasing an amazing game or other piece of
        software to them. You must have a stable financial history and expected
        stable financial future. You must have ample funding to buy all the
        official Nintendo equipment to develop for the system. Most game
        development houses don't even get that far. Most games on the market
        today are put out by what is referred to as a publisher. Game
        development houses will produce their game partially, show it to a
        publisher, and the publisher (who already has this development contract
        with Nintendo) will fund the game development house and market their
        game. All this bureaucracy makes it very difficult for the common
        person to produce their own, personal-use games.
      </p><p>
        This is where the homebrew movement comes in. Dedicated hobbyists spend
        weeks reverse engineering the Nintendo DS hardware, just to make it
        possible for common people to produce for the system (by providing a
        cheap alternative to official Nintendo development). These dedicated
        hobbyists come from all walks of life and cultures, many from Europe
        and the U.S., and bring with them great knowledge. These people make up
        the homebrew movement.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm88"></a>Is Homebrew Legal?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Homebrew is legal for a number of reasons. You own the hardware you
        reverse engineer, so you are free to do with it as you will so long as
        you don't break the law. Breaking the law would include breaking
        proprietary copy protection, pirating video games, publishing illegally
        obtained trade secrets, or otherwise trying to profit off someone
        else's hard work. Homebrew poses no threat to the official developer
        kit, as it is so primitive in comparison. Even if you made something to
        compete with officially produced software, it would be near impossible
        to publish it. Companies often benefit from homebrew communities.
        Although software pirates often steal from homebrew discoveries to
        pirate software, the homebrew community abhors piracy and takes a
        strong stance against it.
      </p><p>
        When you buy a piece of hardware, you own it. This means that you are
        free to break it open, dive into it, reverse engineer it, and so forth.
        You may void your warranty, but thats the price for learning the
        intimacies of any system. The only illegal things on this line would be
        to put into production and sell products made with patented features
        (without negotiating a production deal with he patent owner), bypassing
        or breaking copy-protection, or stealing software code. Reverse
        engineering to learn about how the hardware works and to make something
        fun for the community is totally fine.
      </p><p>
        The homebrew tools available for game programming are far behind
        anything the game company who produced the system could provide (the
        official development kits). Game system developers have an intimate
        knowledge of the hardware, as they developed it. The homebrew community
        has only outsider knowledge through experimentation with the hardware.
      </p><p>
        It would be close to impossible to publish a game made with homebrew
        tools. Nintendo would not license your game. It would be hard to find
        another publisher who would try to publish something made with homebrew
        tools against Nintendo's will. On other systems besides the Nintendo
        DS, this is also true.
      </p><p>
        Companies often don't have a problem with homebrew because it increases
        the demand for their gaming systems and helps them to learn more about
        their consumer base. One example of this is with the Xbox. The Xbox
        homebrew community made the Xbox do things that Microsoft never thought
        consumers wanted like playindie games, emulate classic game systems,
        run the Linux operating system, and so forth. Microsoft then included a
        lot of these features (excepting Linux, of course) in their most recent
        gaming console, the Xbox 360 via a system called XNA Game Sudio and
        Xbox LIVE Arcade (XBLA). If a company wants to squash homebrew
        developers for whatever reason, they'll be smashing an essential fan
        base that loves that company's hardware design and has the potential to
        improve it (all at no cost to the company). Homebrew caused such a high
        demand for the Xbox that it would not have been in Microsoft's best
        interests to ignore or punish it.
      </p><p>
        The downside of homebrew is that software pirates often steal from the
        discoveries of homebrew and use that information to bypass
        copy-protection and to pirate games. Some companies may take a stance
        against homebrew for this reason, but doing so is unproductive. Piracy
        is regrettably inevitable in any industry. It is extremely destructive,
        annihilating game development houses because publishers will no longer
        publish their games due to a high piracy rating on the platform the
        game developers are developing for. Homebrew developers know this, and
        as the amateur brothers of the official game developers, they share the
        pain. Homebrew will usually keep all information regarding
        copy-protection in high secrecy; even if they know how to copy games,
        they will not share the information. The homebrew community does not
        want to see the the system they so dearly love come to an early death.

        The purpose of the pass through is to allow the running of programs on
        the Nintendo DS through the Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridge slot. This
        is done because normal Nintendo DS games, which run from the Nintendo
        DS (NDS) card slot, are encrypted. Since it might be illegal to break
        that encryption, as it is a form of proprietary copy protection, we
        have to get the Nintendo DS to run code from a different place than the
        NDS card slot. Also, it is much easier to bypass the encryption than to
        try and break it.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm101"></a>How a PassMe Works</h2></div></div></div><p>
        When the Nintendo DS first boots, it reads a header from the Nintendo
        DS card inserted into the NDS card slot. The Nintendo DS will read a
        small block of information from the beginning of the game, known as the
        header, which contains information about the game (including the title
        of the game, date it was released and by who, the icon, and some
        hardware information). This header contains a pointer to a location in
        memory to begin executing code. The passthrough's job is to read this
        header and modify it to point to a location someplace on the GBA
        cartridge inserted into the GBA cart slot. What location would this be?
        Why, our code of course.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm104"></a>History of the Passthrough</h2></div></div></div><p>
        DarkFader (Rafael Vuijk) may have been the first to create a
        passthrough device. He designed his passthrough with an FPGA (Field
        Programmable Gate Array) and later packaged it into a single CPLD. Many
        other people (including Kraln, Firefly, and Natrium42) have developed a
        passthrough independently from DarkFader, but he is self-credited as
        its initial creator.
      </p><p>
        Over the next few months following the creation of the passthrough,
        Lynx and Natrium42, both major players in the early homebrew community,
        started their own online stores selling pre-made passthrough devices
        called "PassMe"s. Many budding DS programmers bought their first
        passthrough from Lynx or Natrium42's stores (myself included). Lynx's
        store, DSPassme.com, is still up and running today, providing a great
        option when looking to purchase a passthrough device.
      </p><div class="figure"><a id="idm108"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 2.1.Â Picture of an early PassMe (left) and an FPGA (right)</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/passme.png" alt="Picture of an early PassMe (left) and an FPGA (right)" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/ufb-x_profil.jpg" alt="Picture of an early PassMe (left) and an FPGA (right)" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm116"></a>The Future is Now, and Now, and Now, and Now</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The PassMe was the first device invented to allow homebrew software to
        be run on the Nintendo DS. After Nintendo decided to crack down a
        little harder, in efforts to prevent piracy, these devices no longer
        worked on new Nintendo DS systems. The community then developed the
        PassMe 2. This device was more fancy in how it bypassed the copy
        protection of the Nintendo DS and also required the operator to have
        more resources (a GBA flash cart with SRAM) and go through a more
        involved process. After a while, a device called the NoPass surfaced.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm119"></a>About the NoPass</h2></div></div></div><p>
        A NoPass pretends to be a real Nintendo DS game card. It contains code
        that is encrypted in the same manner as a real Nintendo DS game. The
        encryption was broken by Martin Korth, who discovered a way to dump the
        Nintendo DS BIOS. He then reverse engineered the encryption information
        from the BIOS code. NoPass devices are technically not considered
        passthroughs, since they don't bypass the copy protection of the
        Nintendo DS.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm122"></a>About Slot-1 Devices</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Recently, due to Martin Korth's work, homebrew engineers have
        discovered a way to create a device that runs homebrew software from
        the Nintendo DS card slot (Slot-1). These new devices contain small
        passthrough devices (of the NoPass style) inside them that allow them
        to bypass copy protection as well some means of providing memory to the
        Nintendo DS (via built-in flash memory or a microSD card slot). These
        devices are called "Slot-1 devices". The older style devices that plug
        into the GBA cart slot are referred to as "Slot-2 devices".
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm125"></a>How do I get a Passthrough</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Today, many passthrough and NoPass devices are on the market. It is
        highly recommended by the homebrew community to buy one from a fellow
        developer and not a company that commercially produces hardware meant
        for pirating Nintendo DS software. Thus, one should not buy a SuperPass
        or SuperKey from SuperCard, a MagicKey or MK4-Mini from NeoFlash, a
        PassKey from G6Flash, a PassKey or Passcard from M3Adapter, or a Max
        Media Launcher from the horrid Datel (a very unprofessional company run
        by immature anti-Nintendo kiddies). Each of these companies
        manufactures hardware that is used to pirate Nintendo DS software and
        should be avoided at all costs. The best place to buy a passthrough
        device today is from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/oscommerce/catalog/index.php" target="_top">DSPassme.com</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm129"></a>Which Passthrough Should I Buy?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        It is recommended that you purchase a NoPass or a Slot-1 homebrew
        device, as these work on all Nintendo DS systems with no troubles or
        other complications whatsoever. The older passthroughs, like PassMe,
        don't work on all Nintendo DS systems, and the PassMe 2 requires extra
        work and resources to use, not to mention they both stick out of your
        Nintendo DS like a sore thumb and are hard to keep in your pocket.
      </p><p>
        Slot-1 devices also have many other advantages over Slot-2 devices and
        passthroughs. You definitely want to get a Slot-1 device. For instance,
        Slot-2 devices suck up a lot more power than Slot-1 devices do. This
        means that using a Slot-1 device will give you more battery life than
        using a Slot-2 device. Many Slot-1 devices also double as NoPass
        devices, so you don't need to buy both a passthrough and a Slot-2
        device anymore.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm133"></a>How would I choose an old style passthrough?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        If you still want to buy an old fashioned style passthrough, there are
        a number of things you'll need to consider. Depending on what kind of
        Nintendo DS you have, you can buy either of two different types of
        passthrough devices. The first one, akin to the original made by
        DarkFader, is the "PassMe". The PassMe will probably work on most early
        "phat" (non-Nintendo DS Lite) Nintendo DS systems.
      </p><p>
        However, if your Nintendo DS is newer (both phat and Lite systems can
        be new), you will most likely need a "PassMe 2". The need for a PassMe
        2 came about because of a change in the firmware of newer Nintendo DS
        systems. These newer systems do not allow the header to be changed to
        point to code in the GBA slot. However, it is possible to point to code
        in the GBA carts SRAM still. The PassMe 2 points to some certain
        instructions that have been loaded into memory by the currently
        inserted DS game. This location is an SWI (software interrupt) call to
        the SRAM on the GBA port. The GBA carts SRAM contains the necessary
        code to jump to code lo- cated on GBA cart. The DS then is told to run
        this code and thus redirects to code in the GBA slot. Each PassMe 2 has
        to be programmed to work with one specific game, as the certain code to
        redirect to the GBA slot is found in different places within different
        DS games.

        There are a few tricks you can pull to determine your firmware version.
        It involves pictochat and pulling a cartridge out of your Nintendo DS.
        The screen will change a certain color. Based on this color you can

        It is recommended that you purchase a NoPass instead of a PassMe or
        PassMe 2 passthrough device if you are unsure which to get, as they are
        guaranteed to work with all Nintendo DS systems, past, present, and
        future. If you have a friend with a newer DS who may need to borrow
        your NoPass to play your games, it's always helpful to have a universal
        method of running them.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm180"></a>PassMe 2 Buying Tips</h2></div></div></div><p>
          When ordering a PassMe 2, be sure to select one pre-programmed to a
          common game that you own, such as the Metroid Prime Hunters Demo or
          Super Mario 64 DS. Each PassMe 2 must be programmed to a specific
          game and it is best to select a game that is in large supply. Also,
          you'll need a GBA flash cart with some SRAM on it. Most GBA flash
          carts have SRAM, but be sure to check your cart before trying to
          obtain a PassMe 2. Some newer GBA flash carts might only support save
          games on flash, so simply knowing that your flash cart supports save
          games isn't enough.
        </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm183"></a>How do I use my Passthrough</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Using a passthrough device is quite simple. Simply insert a game into
        the card slot on the passthrough and plug the device into the DS card
        slot on the top of your DS, like any other game. <a class="xref" href="#passme_in_use" title="FigureÂ 2.2.Â The PassMe inserted into the DS card slot">FigureÂ 2.2, âThe PassMe inserted into the DS card slotâ</a> illustrates what this looks like.

        One of the best things to do once you get your passthrough is to
        install a patch to your Nintendo DS firmware known as "FlashMe." This
        firmware patch allows for the running of unsigned wifi binaries as well
        as the redirecting of the Nintendo DS to boot from the GBA slot in NDS
        mode. This means that after installing FlashMe, you no longer need your
        PassMe. FlashMe is the preferred and recommended method of running your
        own software. You no longer have to lug around a passthrough or play
        with a large block sticking out of the back of your DS. Also, you can
        send your code via wireless multiboot (WMB), if you so desire, and
        avoid having to use a flash cart. In addition to all those things, in
        case you ever come across some malicious code that zaps your firmware
        or otherwise messes up your DS, FlashMe keeps a recovery program in the
        protected firmware space that you can run to save your DS. Because of
        this feature alone, FlashMe is better than the standard firmware.
        FlashMe can be obtained from <a class="ulink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/flashme/" target="_top">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/flashme/</a>.

        There are a few ways of getting your code into the Nintendo DS. The
        first of which is the simple GBA flash cart. These flash carts are
        generally quite expensive, have a low availability, and donât hold very
        much memory. They fit into the phat Nintendo DS systems perfectly and
        do not stick out from the bottom, except on the Nintendo DS Lite, as
        other things do. The second way of running code is on a removable
        memory device. These kinds of devices come in two flavors: Slot-1 and
        Slot-2. Slot-2 devices, such as the M3 Adapter, G6 Flash, NeoFlash,
        SuperCard, and the GBA Movie Player, generally support both Nintendo DS
        and GBA software. Slot-1 devices, such as the M3 Simply, R4DS, M3 Real,
        DS-X, NinjaDS, and the Cyclo DS Evolution, generally only support
        Nintendo DS software. Slot-1 devices also fit into the Nintendo DS
        perfectly. The first four of those Slot-2 devices are produced by
        supporters of piracy and should be avoided. It is recommended to use
        the GBA Movie Player (GBAMP) if you want to use a Slot-2 device. With
        Slot-1 devices, we don't have too much of a choice but to choose the
        lesser of many evils.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm201"></a>Which Slot-1 Device should I buy?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        As there are no homebrew produced devices made by hombrew people for
        homebrew people (yet), we regretfully have to buy devices designed and
        sold for piracy when buying NoPass or Slot-1 devices. That said, the
        most important feature to consider when buying one of these devices is
        DLDI support.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm204"></a>What is DLDI?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        DLDI stands for dynamically linked device interface. In order for the
        homebrew filesystem, known as libfat, to work, you'll need a device
        which supports the DLDI standard. DLDI specifies a system by which DLDI
        modules can be dynamically loaded into homebrew software. This allows
        developers to release one version of their homebrew which the software
        end users simply patch and then run on a device of their choice. If you
        buy a device that does not support DLDI, you will be out of luck when
        wanted to run a majority of the homebrew applications and games out
        there. Not to mention that the company producing the device is
        essentially saying, "We don't need to spend time catering to the
        homebrew community since our device is designed just for piracy." We'd
        be better off not supporting that kind of company with our business.
      </p><p>
        You can learn more about DLDI and how to use it at the DLDI Wiki
        website, <a class="ulink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_top">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>.

        There are so many Slot-1 devices on the market today. Choosing one of
        them has become very difficult, as the choices are so many. In this
        manual, I'll discuss the devices I'm familiar with, which nifty
        features they propport, and how they compare to one another.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm212"></a>R4DS</h2></div></div></div><p>
        This device is built well. It is the most sturdy of the three. It uses
        microSD cards for storage and supports DLDI. This means that you can
        run homebrew software and use the microSD card's filesystem. With the
        most recent firmware, it can even automatically patch generic DLDI
        homebrew software with the proper DLDI driver for the R4DS on the fly.
        This means that you don't have to use your PC to patch your homebrew
        software before placing it onto your microSD card. The R4DS cannot use
        microSDHC cards, however. Some people have complained about the spring
        loaded microSD slot, so the makers of R4DS have removed it from current
        models. The R4DS is a great device overall and well supported by the
        Nintendo DS homebrew community, but it does not support running GBA
        software unfortunately.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm215"></a>M3 Real</h2></div></div></div><p>
        This device comes in varying configurations for your various needs. It
        comes with both a Slot-1 device and a Slot-2 device. The Slot-2 device
        is what differs between the three M3 Real configurations. In the first
        and cheapest configuration, the Slot-2 pack is simply a rumble pack. In
        the second and more expensive version, the Slot-2 pack is a dual rumble
        and RAM pack. This configuration will also run GBA homebrew. The flash
        cart size is kept secret by M3, for some reason. Natrium42 was kind
        enough to inform me that, after doing a few tests on the pack, that it
        is at least 8MB in size, but lacks SRAM. The third and most expensive
        configuration, dubbed the "GBA Expansion Package", provides a Slot-2
        pack with rumble, SRAM, and 32MB of RAM. 
      </p><p>
        The M3 Real supports DLDI as well. I'm not sure if it can automatially
        patch homebrew with its own driver on the fly, however. The homebrew
        software may need to be patched on a PC before being transferred to the
        SD card.
      </p><p>
        The M3 Real supports microSD and microSDHC cards, unlike the R4DS. So
        if you are in the mood for massive storage, the M3 Real can be your
        friend.

        This device has very recently come to market, but is already making a
        big impression in the community. The Cyclo DS Evolution has the best
        looking and functioning menu system of the three devices, in my
        opinion. And if you don't like it, the menus are skinnable with a
        number of skins already available for the device. You might be
        thinking, "Why would I care what my menus look or act like?" Well, when
        you use the device to load your software over and over and over again,
        bad menus really piss you off. When you can't use the touch screen to
        scroll up and down and select items and have to use the keys, but
        holding down the keys doesn't make the menu scroll by and you have to
        press the up and down buttons a lot to get to your software, you get
        pissed off. And yes, there really are menus that are this bad.
      </p><p>
        Aside from the pleasant menus, the Cyclo DS Evolution supports DLDI. It
        also features on the fly DLDI patching. I dislike having to patch my
        games on my PC before loading them onto my microSD card, so this is a
        great feature.
      </p><p>
        My favorite feature of the Cyclo DS Evolution is the "remember what I
        loaded last time and load that same program again" feature. Simply
        holding down L and R at boot will boot the last thing that was booted.
        This enables me to avoid navigating the menu system when I'm debugging
        a program and running it repeatedly for testing.
      </p><p>
        The Cyclo DS Evolution also has a NoPass mode where it will act as a
        NoPass to boot your GBA flash carts, a GBA Movie Player, or any other
        Slot-2 device.
      </p><p>
        As you've probably noticed, as I've written the most about the Cyclo DS
        Evolution, that I like it the best of the three devices. It is
        competitively priced with the others, which is good. While it doesn't
        support running GBA software, it feature rich on the Nintendo DS side
        of things. I recommend the Cyclo DS Evlolution to meet all of your
        Slot-1 needs and desires.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm227"></a>Where do I get one of these Slot-1 devices?</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Out of the many places to buy these devices, I've been most happy with
        electrobee. electrobee is run by a trusted member of the homebrew
        community and ships worldwide from good ol' Canada (as opposed to who
        knows where). Their prices are quite often the best, too. When you are
        ready to purchase a Slot-1 device, I recommend that you visit <a class="ulink" href="http://electrobee.com/index.php?ref=16" target="_top">electrobee.com</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm231"></a>The Slot-2 Device of Choice</h2></div></div></div><p>
        If you decide that GBA software development is important for you, you
        might want to consider getting a NoPass and a Slot-2 device. The NoPass
        will allow you to run Nintendo DS software from your Slot-2 device. The
        Slot-2 device, on its own, will be able to run GBA software. If you
        only care about Nintendo DS software, a Slot-1 device will meet your
        needs well.
      </p><p>
        The GBA Movie Player is a wonderful device which can run your software
        from a Compact Flash card. Compact Flash cards are very cheap and in
        high supply. If you have more SD cards than CF cards around,
        unfortunately, the only way to run NDS software from an SD card at this
        time is with the SD versions of the SuperCard or M3 Adapter. The GBAMP
        also sticks out from the bottom of the Nintendo DS a little, as shown
        in <a class="xref" href="#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart" title="FigureÂ 3.1.Â Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right) inserted into a DS">FigureÂ 3.1, âComparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)

        With the GBA flash cart, the process of loading your programs into
        memory is a bit slow. Also, each GBA flash cart writer is specific to
        certain carts and often have closed source drivers. This means that
        most flash carts will be incompatible with Linux or Macintosh
        computers. In actuality, the only good thing about a GBA flash cart is
        that it does not stick out from the Nintendo DS, as can be seen in
        <a class="xref" href="#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart" title="FigureÂ 3.1.Â Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right) inserted into a DS">FigureÂ 3.1, âComparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)

        If you chose to go with the GBA flash cart, you can use a utility
        called Darkainâs MultiNDS Loader to load multiple programs onto your
        flash cart. This way, you donât have to re-flash your cart each time
        you want to run a different application.
      </p><p>
        If you chose to go with the GBAMP, then Iâd highly recommend
        DragonMinded's DSOrganize. It supports booting multiple programs, text
        editing, address books, calendars, and more. It's a great application
        for the DS. You can get it from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_top">http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize</a>. However,
        you cannot use a stock GBAMP to run NDS programs. You have to flash it
        with some custom ï¬rmware. Instructions and firmware are available from
        <a class="ulink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html" target="_top">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html</a>.
      </p><p>
        As for Slot-1 devices, these all usually come with their own menu
        systems (often incorrectly referred to as operating systems). You won't
        have to do anything special to run multiple software titles.

        devkitPro is a brand, like Microsoft or Adobe. You don't use Nintendo
        DS software anymore than you write your letters with Microsoft or edit
        photos with Adobe. devkitPro produces a collection of toolchains for
        homebrew developers. Toolchains are available for Game Boy Advance,
        GP32, Playstation Portable, GameCube, and the Nintendo DS. The
        toolchain we are most interested in is known as devkitARM.
      </p><p>
        devkitARM is a specific toolchain of devkitPro. It allows the compiling
        of ARM binaries from most all computers. It is based on gcc, the gnu
        compiler collection. devkitARM includes everything you'll need to
        create software for the Nintendo DS, GBA, and GP32; all of which are
        run by the ARM processor. However, we will be using something to make
        our job much easier in addition to just devkitARM.

        libnds, the library for Nintendo DS, started out its life as NDSLIB.
        NDSLIB was a simple library created by joat (Michael Noland) and dovoto
        (Jason Rogers). The name was changed to libnds over the course of a few
        months and the maintainer has been changed to WinterMute (Dave Murphy).
      </p><p>
        NDSLIB started out as a collection of defines for common memory
        locations in the DS. This is useful, as you can simply reference
        BG_BMP_RAM instead of 0x06000000. Eventually, the library began to
        include structs and unions and other useful constructs that help to
        simplify the programmers job and abstract certain portions of the
        hardware from the programmer.
      </p><p>
        Today, libnds is an incredibly useful library that over 96% of the
        Nintendo DS homebrew community uses.

        Since the beginning of time, humans have used raster displays to draw
        electronic images. Raster images aren't used too much anymore, in
        practice. However, most all displays still act like raster displays
        from a programming perspective. Each physical display on the Nintendo
        DS is actually an LCD screen which works nothing like a raster display
        in actuality, but the electronics that control it provide an interface
        to the graphics engines on the Nintendo DS that is very much like a
        raster display.
      </p><p>
        So what is a raster display? Put simply, it is just like a television
        display. A beam of electrons blasts away at the back of a phoshor
        coated screen in a deterministic way (known as a raster scan). The
        beam, from the perspective of a person watching the television, travels
        from left to right, one scan line at a time. The beam never blast
        electrons from right to left. After the beam reaches the right edge of
        the screen, it turns off and moves to the left edge and down one line.
        When the beam finally reaches the bottom line of the screen, it travels
        back up to the upper left of the screen and begins this drawing process
        all over again. <a class="xref" href="#raster_display" title="FigureÂ 5.1.Â The Raster Display">FigureÂ 5.1, âThe Raster Displayâ</a> illustrates this
        process in an exaggerated fashion.
      </p><p>
        Two things are important to remember here. First, that the period of
        time during which the beam goes from right to left (not drawing
        anything) is called the horizontal blanking period, or hblank. Second,
        that the period of time during which the beam goes from bottom to top
        (again, not drawing anything) is called the vertical blanking period,
        or vblank. Knowing about vblank is useful for us as Nintendo DS
        programmers because it is the period of time in which we will tell the
        Nintendo DS to draw things. If we didn't, then the Nintendo DS display
        might be in the middle of drawing the screen when we tell it what to
        draw. This would give us strange artifacts and is generally
        undesirable.

        The Nintendo DS has two screens. As such, it has two graphics engines,
        one for each screen. The first engine is referred to as the "main"
        engine, while the second is called the "sub" engine. Both of these
        engines can put in charge of either screen. By default, libnds tells
        the main engine to operate the top physical screen and the sub screen
        the bottom physical screen.
      </p><p>
        Each engine supports up to four backgrounds and up to 128 sprites. They
        operate independently of each other, each with their own control
        registers, backgrounds, sprites, graphics data, and palettes. To use an
        engine, we must first turn them on. Then we place the engine into a
        certain mode of operation. Next, we map memory for use with the
        engines. Finally, we load their memory with graphics data and palettes
        and they automatically just draw what we've set them up to do.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm319"></a>The Fifth Mode</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Each of these graphics engines can be placed into one of seven
        different modes that support different features. In this manual, we'll
        cover one of the more common graphic modes, Mode 5. It is commonly used
        because it is very flexible and allows for some amazing special
        effects. We'll learn how to display multiple 15-bit color 1-bit alpha

        An affine background, also known as an external rotation background or
        exrot background, is one that has the ability to be transformed by an

        the scope of this manual, I will cover briefly how to set up a basic
        affine background, but not get into rotating, scaling, or sheering it.
        For this manual, we'll just apply an identity transform, a transform
        that doesn't actually change the background, to our backgrounds. With
        an affine transformation matrix, you can rotate, scale, and sheer an
        affine background, among other interesting effects. If you want to
        learn about the cool effects you can do with an affine background and
        an affine transformation matrix, I recommend you look at Cearn's
        tutorial on affine transformations at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/affine.htm" target="_top">http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/affine.htm</a>.

        In order to get the hardware to do what we want, we have to first
        initialize it. This means turning on the 2D graphics core. This is
        where we first fall in love with libnds. (We'll fall in love with it
        repeatedly over the course of this manual.) libnds makes it incredibly
        simple to do these two things. Add the following code to your new

        four variables. <a class="xref" href="#libnds_affine_bg_api" title="FigureÂ 5.2.Â libnds Affine Background API">FigureÂ 5.2, âlibnds Affine Background APIâ</a> shows the names

        What we'll do now is add three backgrounds. We'll put a splash screen
        on the top physical screen, a starfield on the bottom physical screen,
        and a planet placed atop the starfield background. To do this, we'll
        use SUB_BG3 (although we could use SUB_BG2) for the splash screen and
        both backgrounds 2 and 3 on the main screen for the planet and
        starfield respectively. In order to make sure the planet shows up above
        the starfield as opposed to below it, we give the planet a priority
        number less than that of the starfield's priority number. Relatively
        lower priority numbers place backgrounds relatively above other
        backgrounds. There are only four priority numbers per graphics engine
        that we can assign to backgrounds (priority numbers 0-3).
      </p><p>
        We'll now use that nice API libnds provides us for both the background
        control registers and the affine transformation matrix. Let's proceed

        What's up with all those "&lt;&lt; 8" thingies? Those are fixed point
        numbers. The Nintendo DS expects many values to be in varying fixed
        point formats. A fixed point number is simply a way of specifying
        multiples of fractions to represent non-integer values. For example, if
        we use an integer variable to store a US Dollar amount, we might
        initially think we can only represent whole dollar values. However, if
        we decide to store US pennies in the integer as opposed to whole dollar
        values, we can all of a sudden represent fractions of US Dollars with
        our integer. We can have 1.21 US Dollars by saying we have 121 pennies.
      </p><p>
        Common notation for fixed point types looks like 1.31, 1.7.24, 8.8, and
        etc. To interpret this notation, we read from right to left. First, we
        find the number of bits used to specify fractional parts. The next
        number will be the number of bits for whole number parts. And, if there
        is another number, it will usually indicate the sign of the number as
        being either positive or negative with one bit. <a class="xref" href="#fixed_point" title="FigureÂ 5.3.Â Integer variables can be used to represent fractions.">FigureÂ 5.3, âInteger variables can be used to represent
        fractions.â</a> illustrates the concept of fixed point numbers.
      </p><div class="figure"><a id="fixed_point"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 5.3.Â Integer variables can be used to represent
        fractions.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/fixed_point.svg" alt="Integer variables can be used to represent fractions." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm454"></a>The Basics of DMA</h2></div></div></div><p>
        DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. DMA allows the reading and writing
        of memory independently of the CPU. The Nintendo DS has special,
        dedicated DMA hardware to do quick and moderately effcient moving of
        memory. DMA is not very efficient for memory fill operations, however,
        as the data to fill with needs to be read once for every write. Libnds
        provides us with a few functions to make use of the DMA hardware in the
        Nintendo DS.
      </p><p>
        Whenever you have the opportunity to use DMA, you should. It is always
        better to use DMA than to use a for loop to copy data. When using DMA
        to copy from main memory, do not forget to flush main memory before
        using DMA. The DMA doesn't use the cache where the relevant memory may
        currently be stored, so flushing to main memory guarantees that DMA
        sees the correct data. Another issue to consider would be that in the
        middle of a DMA, the main CPUs are prevented from using certain memory
        hardware. This can cause
        awkward bugs with interrupt handling. For this reason, and <code class="code"><code class="function">swifastcopy</code></code> may be safer,
        and is not too much slower. The safest bet is always <code class="code"><code class="function">memcopy</code></code> and <code class="code"><code class="function">memset</code></code>, if you are running
        into some bugs.
      </p><p>
        The declaration of <code class="code"><code class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</code></code> from libnds
        is as follows.
      </p><div class="funcsynopsis"><table border="0" class="funcprototype-table" summary="Function synopsis" style="cellspacing: 0; cellpadding: 0;"><tr><td><code class="funcdef">static inline void

        In our program, we will use <code class="code"><code class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</code></code> to load
        some graphics into memory. We use the function <code class="code"><code class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</code></code> instead of
        <code class="code"><code class="function">dmaCopy</code></code> because it is
        more explicit as to how it is copying and it lets us specify which DMA
        channel to use when copying. We'll use the same channel (channel 3)
        that the ordinary <code class="code"><code class="function">dmaCopy</code></code> uses, though. It
        also let's us specify which DMA channel to use when copying. Let's
        start out by writing some functions to display our backgrounds. Since
        we've already set up the hardware to display the data in the desired
        manner, right after the copy we will get some nice images displayed on
        our screens. If we didn't set up our backgrounds first, we'd most
        likely get garbage on the screen until we eventually did set up the
        background control registers.

        The default template makefile will turn your graphic files into object
        files for linking into your program. Never include data as a header
        file.
      </p><p>
        The graphics must be in a lossless image format, such as gif, tif, bmp,
        or png in order to work with the provided template makefile. I prefer
        the png graphic format. Image conversion is usually done by a program
        called <span class="command"><strong>grit</strong></span>. The provided template makefile will ask
        <span class="command"><strong>grit</strong></span> to convert images in the
        <code class="filename">gfx</code> folder of your project root to a format ready
        for the Nintendo DS.
      </p><p>
        The provided template makefile, adapted from the default libnds
        template makefile, is a good base for most all projects. It will look
        in a folder called <code class="filename">gfx</code> (in the same directory as
        the makefile) for your graphics. If any are found, it uses a special
        bin2o rule to tell grit to turn your images into .o files, according to
        grit rule files (with the .grit files extension), which can be linked
        into your program. <span class="command"><strong>grit</strong></span> will create a header file
        (.h) for your data. The name format for them works like so: if a file
        is called <code class="filename">orangeShuttle.png</code> the header file will
        be called <code class="filename">orangeShuttle.h</code>. Inside this header file
        will be a reference to the data in the .o, named orangeShuttleTiles and
        orangeShuttlePal or orangeShuttleBitmap, depending on how the grit file
        specifies which format to convert your image into. It will also include
        the length in bytes of the data references as orangeShuttleTilesLen and
        orangeShuttlePalLen or orangeShuttleBitmapLen.
      </p><p>
        For our project, we'll be putting the our graphic files and grit rule
        files into the <code class="filename">gfx</code> directory and having the

        It is now a standard tool in Nintendo DS and GBA development where
        aforeto there was no universal method of image conversion.
      </p><p>
        To use grit, we make a grit rule file. This file has the .grit file
        extension an contains important information telling grit how we want
        our image converted. You can learn about how grit works by reading its
        built-in help by running the command <span class="command"><strong>grit</strong></span> with no
        parameters. I've also provided commented grit rule files for all images
        we will use in this manual. These make good examples and can help you
        get the hang of using grit.

        No, sprites are not magical fairies. It is a term in 2D graphics
        programming which refers to an image or animation. The Nintendo DS has
        dedicated hardware for dealing with sprites. This makes the system very
        useful for 2D. Most gaming systems do not have a 2D core, and all
        sprites and other 2D graphics have to be handled manually by painting
        2D images on the side of a quad within 3D space.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm533"></a>The OAM</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The OAM manages all the sprites. This is an immense job, most of it
        done behind the scenes for us. After using it, you might think it
        magical. It's not as magical as it seems, however. OAM stands for
        Object Attribute Memory. It is the place in memory we use to keep track
        of and control our sprites. The OAM works with a SpriteEntry and a
        SpriteRotation struct to manage the attributes of our sprites.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm536"></a>Information About the Sprite Hardware</h2></div></div></div><p>
        On the Nintendo DS, we can have up to 128 sprites. Only 32 of those
        sprites can be affine transformed (rotated, scaled, skewed, etc.). We
        are also only allowed to address 1024 different tiles to comprise all
        of our sprites, per engine. Sprites can be made of tiles that use 16
        colors or of ones that use 256 colors. Tiles that use 256 colors are
        twice as large as tiles that use only 16 colors. Another advantage of
        using 16-color sprites is the ability to use 16 different palettes.
        When using 256-color sprites, each sprite (and tile) must use the same
        palette. When using 16-color sprites, we can have one sprite use one
        16-color palette and another sprite use a different 16-color palette,
        even though both use the same tile data. Games often use this trick to
        make different colored enemies that look the same. The sprites still
        use the same tile data, but they use different palettes.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm539"></a>How Sprites are Stored in Memory</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Sprites are broken into 8x8 pixel pieces. This is called tiling. When
        drawn to screen, the hardware pieces these tiles together, like a
        puzzle where the pieces have no distinguishing edges. There are two
        ways to tile sprites, 1D and 2D. In a 2D layout, the sprite memory is
        treated like a giant image from which sprite tiles are obtained by
        making a box the size of the sprite and placing it over the giant
        image. In a 1D layout, the sprites are layed out in a linear fashion,
        as discussed in <a class="xref" href="#sprite_tile_layout" title="FigureÂ 6.1.Â  The upper text shows information as it would be on a non-tiled background. The lower text shows the same data, tiled, for use in tiled graphic modes.">FigureÂ 6.1, â
          The upper text shows information as it would be on a non-tiled
          background. The lower text shows the same data, tiled, for use in
          tiled graphic modes.
        â</a>.
      </p><p>
        The conversion process is very similar to that for backgrounds. We
        simple make grit rule files that tell grit how we want our images
        converted, and it generates a .o and a header file for us. The grit
        rule files and image files go into the same place as background images,
        the <code class="filename">gfx&gt;</code> folder.

        Sprites have three attribute variables associated with them. With them,
        sprites can spin and flip and mosaic and perform all sorts of fun
        hardware effects. Each attribute is multi-purpose and requires some
        amount of bit twiddling and masking to achieve the affects we want.
        That is, it would if it weren't for this nice SpriteEntry union which
        libnds provides for us. In most cases, we will use this union to do
        what we'd like to with our sprites, but there are special cases where
        this is not possible.
      </p><p>
        We will cover how to update, initialize, and rotate using bit twiddling
        methods, as libnds doesn't yet provide ways of doing this otherwise.
        libnds provides the means to do other things that we'll be doing with
        sprites though, like move them, we'll be doing. We'll use the libnds
        API wherever possible. Let's write some functions to do each of those,
        in that order.
      </p><p>
        I provide you with a header file, located with the acompanying source
        at <code class="filename">code/chapter_6-sprites/include/sprites.h</code> that
        contains a collection of sprite related function declarations. We'll be
        working on the definitions for each of these functions together in a
        new file called <code class="filename">sprites.cpp</code>. Our first step will
        be to create a that new source code file. Put a new file called
        <code class="filename">sprites.cpp</code> into the <code class="filename">source</code>
        folder of your project directory.

        Instead of keeping track of things directly in the OAM, we'll manage a
        copy of the OAM in memory that we will copy over every frame using
        <code class="code"><code class="function">updateOAM</code></code>. The reason
        we do this is because writes to OAM are locked during all times but
        during vblank. We will wait for vblank to occur before copying our copy
        of the OAM into the actualy OAM.
      </p><p>
        Updating the OAM is very straightforward. We do this by copying our
        copy of the OAM to the real OAM. Our copy of the OAM might still be
        stuck in the cache and may not have made it into main memory yet, so we
        first flush local memory (a must whenever performing a DMA operation)
        to ensure that DMA sees the correct data. The data we want to copy
        might be stuck in cache still and may not have made it into main memory
        yet. Then, we tell the OAM to look into the OAMTable instance we will
        create later for information about each one of our sprites.

        Let's get to spinning. This is a bit more difficult than what we've
        done before, but still fun. It's nice to not have to make a separate
        sprite for each rotation position the sprite will be presented in.
        However, doing so may be necessary for some applications as the
        Nintendo DS rotation won't always look as pretty as if the rotations
        had been done elsewhere.
      </p><p>
        The libnds's sin and cos lookup tables employ a 32768 degree system.
        Humans usually use a 360 degree system or radians. The angle we'll work
        with in this function will be one that is part of the 32768 degree
        system. You'll have to convert your radians or weird 360 degree value
        (Seriously, why 360? Silly Babylonians.) to the 32768 degree system
        before using this function in order to see the results you are
        expecting.
      </p><p>
        We have to use a transformation derived from our time spent playing
        with an affine transformation matrix. The sprite's affine
        transformation matrix is used slightly differently from the background
        affine transformation matrix. If you have a background in linear
        algebra, I'd recommend reading up on this portion of the hardware at

        Now for some real fun. Moving sprites in hardware, and not having to

        x and y. This is a case where we don't have to think much about the
        underlying arrangement of this information. The libnds union
        SpriteEntry describes the organization of data to the compiler for us

        the compiler does the bit twiddling and masking for us. Since this is

        The ability to set a sprites priorty is essential when dealing with
        multiple sprites, as we will be doing. As such, we'll now discuss
        sprite priorities and how to set them.
      </p><p>
        A sprite, like a background, has a priorty which determines how the
        sprite will appear with respect to other sprites and to backgrounds. A
        sprite with the same number priorty as a background will appear above
        it. A sprite with a lower priorty number than another sprite will
        appear above that other sprite. There are four priorities per graphics
        engine available for sprites, similar to background priorities.
      </p><p>
        To set the sprite priority, we'll simply set the SpriteEntry property
        priority to one of four different values, depending on which priority
        we wish to assign: OBJPRIORITY_0, OBJPRIORITY_1, OBJPRIORITY_2, or
        OBJPRIORITY_3. The following code listing shows an example of what this
        looks like.

        Now that our sprites.cpp file is finished, let's get on to how sprites
        are stored in memory, how to load them, and so forth. So put away your
        sprites.cpp file into the source directory of your home folder and
        let's get back into our <code class="filename">main.cpp</code> file.

        We'll need to make a place for our sprite data to live in VRAM. Since
        we will be using sprites on the main graphics engine, we can use VRAM
        bank E for our sprites. VRAM bank E is smaller than the other VRAM
        banks we've dealt with so far, as it is only 64 KB in size. However,
        this is more than enough to store 1024 unique 16-color tiles.
      </p><p>
        In our <code class="code"><code class="function">initVideo</code></code>, we
        need to map VRAM bank E for use with sprites on the main graphics
        engine. Then, we need to tell the main engine to enable sprites of the
        tiling style we want. We will use 1D tiled sprites. The resulting
        initVideo function, post-modifications, is presented below .
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
void initVideo() {
  /*
   *  Map VRAM to display a background on the main and sub screens.

   *  The vramSetPrimaryBanks function takes four arguments, one for each of
   *  the major VRAM banks. We can use it as shorthand for assigning values to
   *  each of the VRAM bank's control registers.
   *
   *  We map banks A and B to main screen  background memory. This gives us
   *  256KB, which is a healthy amount for 16-bit graphics.
   *
   *  We map bank C to sub screen background memory.
   *
   *  We map bank D to LCD. This setting is generally used for when we aren't
   *  using a particular bank.
   *
   *  We map bank E to main screen sprite memory (aka object memory).

        We'll be using the same memory alignment (boundary) as the GBA uses for
        our sprites. Tile VRAM addresses must be aligned to 32 bytes. If you
        feel shorted by this, since you can't use all 1024 addressable tiles
        when using 256 color tiles, for instance, then you can look up how to
        use other alignments at <a class="ulink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs" target="_top">http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs</a>. You'll have to
        set REG_DISPCNT (via videoSetMode) with a value defined in
        <code class="filename">libnds/include/nds/arm9/video.h</code> akin to
        DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_XXX (the default, and the method the GBA and we
        use, is DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_32).
      </p><p>
        To compute the address to copy tiles to, we basically need to know two
        things: the memory alignment we are using and the tile numbers we want
        to assign data to. Using the formula from Martin Korth's GBATEK,
        "TileVramAddress = TileNumber * BoundaryValue", and libnds's SPRITE_GFX
        define we can compute the address of any tile as follows.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
static const int BOUNDARY_VALUE = 32; /* This is the default boundary value
                     * (can be set in REG_DISPCNT) */
static const int OFFSET_MULTIPLIER = BOUNDARY_VALUE /
                   sizeof(SPRITE_GFX[0]);
uint16 * tileVramAddress = &amp;SPRITE_GFX[shuttle-&gt;gfxIndex *
                       OFFSET_MULTIPLIER];
      </pre><p>
        We usually want to copy more than one tile into vram at a time,
        however. Luckily, when converting images to sprites with grit, it will
        tell us the length in bytes of our tile data for that sprite. After we
        have the length in bytes, we can use dmaCopyHalfwords (which uses byte
        lengths for copying) to copy the tile data into VRAM. We can also
        calculate how many tiles an image uses from its length in bytes by
        diving the length in bytes by how many bytes a tile takes up. In our
        case, as we'll be using 16-color tiles, a tile (8x8 pixels) takes up 32
        bytes.

        Now, to see a sprite in action. Let's load in the orangeShuttle graphic
        and the moon graphic. Make a new function called <code class="code"><code class="function">initSprites</code></code>. Place it after

        <code class="filename">moon.h</code> now. They contain information about our
        sprites as generated by grit.
      </p><p>
        I've also create a new struct type called "SpriteInfo". This struct
        contains information about sprites that aren't explicitly contained in
        the SpriteEntry struct. We'll be using it to help us manage our
        information about sprites better.

            us keep track of which OAM entry our sprite is associated with.
            We'll also use it to compute other offsets, although we don't have
            to use it for that purpose in many cases.

        In the above code, you'll find some things that look like function
        calls to a function called <code class="code"><code class="function">assert</code></code>. These aren't
        actually function calls, but macro expansions. You'll have to include
        <code class="filename">assert.h</code> in order to use them.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
      </pre><p>
        The assert macro allows the programmer to make assumptions about what
        is going on in the code. To use them, you just place some kind of
        "fact" in between the paranthesis. Whenever this assumption fails, the
        program will quit. Assertions are evaluated at runtime.
      </p><p>
        Assertions help you avoid developing obscure bugs later on since
        they'll stop them right where something first goes wrong. Assertions
        are a good thing and should be used often.
      </p><p>
        When you release a production version of your software, the assertions
        can be removed from your code by the preprocessor. To do this with a
        GNU compiler, like the ones we are using, you simply set NDEBUG.

        Object oriented programming (OOP) is essential to making good games on
        a modern system. Although it is very much possible without object
        oriented programming, OOP is an incredible tool that greatly improves
        code reusability, readability, modularization, and abstraction. It
        makes the programmer's job a lot easier. Also, due to modularization,
        collaborating on projects with your friends or coworkers is easily ten
        fold easier.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm676"></a>The Ship Class</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The first thing we'll make is a Ship class. This class will encapsulate
        all the properties and functionality of any ship in an easy to use and
        understand format. Think of things a ship can do, on a high level. What
        should come to mind is the ability to turn both ways, shoot weapons,
        accelerate, move at a given velocity (coasting), and maybe some more
        things if you are creative enough. What properties of a ship can you
        come up with? Perhaps turning speed, thrust, mass, maximum speed,
        velocity, position, shields? Well, after you are done brainstorming,
        the next step is to write out the functionality and properties we need
        to put into our Ship class. You could make a table, as in <a class="xref" href="#ship_properties_and_functions" title="TableÂ 7.1.Â Table of Ship properties and functionality.">TableÂ 7.1, âTable of Ship properties and functionality.â</a>, or draw some diagrams on a

        I have provided a skeleton framework file for you to write your class
        in. It is all set and ready for you to implement in the
        <code class="filename">ship.cpp</code> file. The header file,
        <code class="filename">ship.h</code> is also included. On your own, with your
        own classes in the future, you should always make a skeleton framework
        class to work from. It makes implementation straightforward and you do
        not have to worry about the semantics of setting up a class so much.

        I have provided you with a simple constructor and private
        initialization method method. These are often mundane things to make.
        In fact, the compiler will automatically make the constructor, copy
        constructor, and operator= methods for you if you don't explicitly make
        them. Feel free to modify the default values in the initializers to try
        out different effects of changing the ship properties.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm721"></a>Acceleration</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Acceleration is probably one of the most important things your ships
        can do. To accelerate, we simply increase our velocity by a certain
        increment, that being the thrust capability of the ship, in the angle
        we are headed. Here is where some simple trigonometry comes into play.
        Since our velocity is stored as a two dimensional vecotr (x and y
        component), we have to shadow our thrust vector onto each direction. We
        do this we multiply the thrust by sin(angle) for our x component, and
        by -cos(angle) for the y direction. Next, after we have computed the
        increment for both x and y, we add them onto our current velocity,
        making sure we donât go over the ship's maximum speed.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
void Ship::accelerate() {
  float incX = thrust * sin(angle);
  float incY = -(thrust * cos(angle));

  //the following method of speed limitation is not accurate, traveling
  //diagonally is faster than straight, which is not the desired limitation
  //a more accurate method is needed at a later time

  velocity.x += incX;
  //make sure can't go too fast in x direction
  if (velocity.x &gt; maxSpeed) {
    velocity.x = maxSpeed;
  }
  if (velocity.x &lt; -maxSpeed) {
    velocity.x = -maxSpeed;
  }

  velocity.y += incY;
  //make sure can't go too fast in y direction
  if (velocity.y &gt; maxSpeed) {
    velocity.y = maxSpeed;
  }
  if (velocity.y &lt; -maxSpeed) {
    velocity.y = -maxSpeed;

        This one is incredibly easy thanks to the Nintendo DS hardware. All we
        have to do is increment our position by our velocity. The hardware
        takes care of any wrapping or offscreen issues.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

        This one took me a while to figure out, even though it's just one line,
        but it's very useful. We can turn the ship around, not a 180 per se,
        but simply pointing into the opposite direction of our current
        velocity. This will get the angle of our velocity with respect to 0
        degrees, and then will do a 180 from that angle.

        we are storing the angle of the ship as a clockwise rotation. This will
        be important to remember for later when we update the ship sprite.

        This one is a bit more tricky and involved. I suppose I should start by
        explaining that a Nintendo DS circle has 32768 degrees. It doesn't
        actually have 32768 degrees, nor does a Nintendo DS even know what a
        circle is, but it is easy to understand the hardware a bit better when
        we think of it this way. I will say, however, that the reason for the
        32768 degrees is due to libnds's built-in look up tables for the sin
        and cos functions. Having only 360 entries in your lookup table would
        be a waste of space when it takes just as many bits to index into a 360
        entry table as it does a 512 entry one. libnds gives us more accuracy
        by presenting a 32768 entry one. More entries allow finer accuracy. In
        order for the Nintendo DS to know how to rotate our sprites, we have to
        convert the internally stored radian angle value to a value within the
        32768 degree system. This is an easy conversion.
      </p><p>
        The first step is to convert to a 360 degree system, as you must have
        learned in junior high school. This is done by multiplying the radian
        value by 180/PI. The 180 part is half the number of degrees in a
        circle. So, in a 32768 degree system we can convert by multiplying the
        radian value by DEGREES_IN_A_CIRCLE/(2 * PI). Lastly, just return that
        value as an integer. (The hardware does not have any floating point, so
        when rotating our sprites, we use a fixed point value disguised as an
        ordinary integer.)
      </p><p>
        Then, we make a function to return a converted angle value, for
        whenever we need it.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
int Ship::radToDeg(float rad) {
    return (int)(rad * (DEGREES_IN_A_CIRCLE/(2 * PI)));
}
int Ship::getAngleDeg() {
    return radToDeg(angle);
}
      </pre></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm747"></a>Linking the Ship into our Program</h2></div></div></div><p>
        We now need to create an instance of the ship in our main function.
        Creating an instance of a class, known as an object, is quite simple,
        as you can see below. We just have to create the Ship object and then
        assign a SpriteEntry to it.
      </p><p>
        We should also do something nifty with our new class so that we can
        verify that what we wrote is working. Let's make the ship move around
        on its own by telling the ship to trust ten times.

    </pre></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm752"></a>Creating the Main Game Loop</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The previous code isn't very exciting, since we never update the OAM
        more than once. We need to begin the creation of what is referred to as
        the game loop. We won't be fully implementing it in this chapter, since
        a major component of it will be missing until we discover input on the
        Nintendo DS.
      </p><p>
        The game loop has at least three major components. The first thing any
        game loop should do is to collect input from the outside world. We
        won't be doing that in this chapter, however. The next component of the
        game loop is updating the game state. Based on inputs the game received
        in the previous frame (to the one we'll render next) and the passing of
        time, the game state will change (if anything interesting is
        happening). The final component of the game loop is the rendering
        component. In our case, we have to update the OAM to let it know of the
        changes that occured in the game state and that it needs to reflect
        those changes.
      </p><p>
        Now that we know what a game loop is, it's time for us to start
        creating one to run our program. The first thing we want to happen in
        our game loop is for the game state to be updated. This is because we
        don't have any input to collect yet. We tell our ship to move at it's
        current velocity. This will change the shipâs position. Then we update
        the sprite attributes with new information about our ship, as some
        properties of the ship have now changed (i.e. its angle and position).
        Note that the rotateSprite function performs a counter-clockwise
        rotation and our ship tracks its angle as a clockwise rotation; this is
        resolved by simplying negating the angle to rotate by. Finally, we call
        a function that will make sure our program does not exceed 60fps (speed
        of the graphics on the Nintendo DS) by waiting for vblank, and then we
        update the OAM, telling it that we changed some attributes on the
        sprites and it needs to handle that.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  for (;;) {
    /* Update the game state. */
    ship-&gt;moveShip();

    /* Update sprite attributes. */
    MathVector2D&lt;float&gt; position = ship-&gt;getPosition();
    shipEntry-&gt;x = (int)position.x;
    shipEntry-&gt;y = (int)position.y;
    rotateSprite(shipRotation, -ship-&gt;getAngleDeg());

    /*
     *  Update the OAM.
     *
     *  We have to copy our copy of OAM data into the actual OAM during
     *  VBlank (writes to it are locked during other times).
     */
    swiWaitForVBlank();
    updateOAM(oam);
  }

  return 0;
}
      </pre><p>
        The OAM really shines through here. The all powerful Nintendo DS
        hardware, an incredible masterpiece, will rotate and move our ship with
        very little effort on our part. In hindsight, all we have done is flip
        a few bits in a few registers in a structured manner, and our ship
        comes to life. Incredible.

        The Nintendo DS has many different user input systems, including
        buttons, touch screen, and a microphone. Most video game systems only
        have buttons and an analog stick or two. While the Nintendo DS does not
        have an analog stick, it does have an amazing touch screen which has
        millions of different creative uses. We will only cover the touch
        screen and buttons, though. If you wish to learn more about the
        microphone, I'd recommend reading, although a bit outdated, the only
        microphone resource I know of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop9.html" target="_top">http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop9.html</a>.

        libnds provides us with a very nice abstraction for key input. Instead
        of having to AND registers with cryptic masks to discover which keys we
        are pressing, we simply call <code class="code"><code class="function">scanKeys</code></code>, then check one of
        three input functions, <code class="code"><code class="function">keysDown()</code></code>, <code class="code"><code class="function">keysHeld</code></code>, or <code class="code"><code class="function">keysUp</code></code>. In order to see
        which keys have been recently pressed, use <code class="code"><code class="function">keysDown</code></code>. To see which keys
        are currently held, use <code class="code"><code class="function">keysHeld</code></code>. To see which keys
        have just been released, use <code class="code"><code class="function">keysUp</code></code>. libnds provides us
        with defines for some key masks as well. How they are set up is

        You have to code it. Let's go!
      </p><p>
        The touch screen a big part of what makes the Nintendo DS awesome. The
        libnds API for using it is cake easy too. We'll be ready for Utada
        Hikaru in no time. Whenever you want to read the current touch
        location, simply call the function <code class="code"><code class="function">touchRead</code></code>. This function
        assigns values to a struct that contains the x and y coordinate of the
        touch. You use it like so.

          You may see code that uses something called the IPC to interact with
          the touch screen. Use of the IPC struct is deprecated. This means
          that you shouldn't use it and should not depend on it being there in
          the future. The method we use to read values from the touch screen
          does not use the IPC struct and is safe for future use.

        This function will be part of our game state updating game loop

        accordingly. As such, it will have to know about and be able to modify

        First, we want the ship to accelerate when we press up. To do this, we
        detect when the Nintendo DS has the up key on the D-pad held (which
        included the initial down press) and accelerate the ship if so. The up
        key will constantly read as held, so long as it is held. Reading the
        input does not affect the keys register. We'll do similar things for
        each of the other keys. See if you can tell what each key does from the
        code listing below.

        As you've noticed, having that Ship class made input handling extremely
        easy. Our keys will directly affect various properties of the ship as
        we press them. This is really amazing, but the true miracle is yet to
        come.
      </p><p>
        As for the moon, since we didn't make one class for it, the code came
        together a little more messily. We also had to pass two parameters to
        the <code class="code"><code class="function">handleInput</code></code>
        function to represent the moon portion of the game state instead of
        one. If we had wanted to be more clean, we could have even produced a
        game state struct that contained all the game state and all operations
        on it in one place.

        want to happen in our game loop is for the key registers and read touch

        all happens for us. Next, we handle the input we just received by

        Sounds are essential in any game. Our little project should be no
        exception. Sounds bring life to various elements in the game, such as
        space ships, weapon systems, rain, sword clashing, car engines, and so
        forth.
      </p><p>
        Many games don't need music. For instance, a game with the programmer's
        or game designer's favorite song may annoy many players who have
        different tastes in music. Instead, give the player the option to
        listen to their own music, on their own audio equipment. Not to
        mention, music can be costly in data size.
      </p><p>
        Sound effects on the other hand, are quite useful. A word of warning,
        however, a game with bad sounds (scratchy, annoying, too repetitive,
        etc.) is worse than a silent game. Take care when engineering sounds
        for your game.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm914"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The Nintendo DS has amazing sound hardware. We will only be able to
        scratch the surface of it, and even still, we won't leave any scratch
        marks. The Nintendo DS has 16 channels to play sounds, numbered 0
        through 15. Channels 8-15 are special channels. All channels can play
        ADPCM or PCM sounds, while 8-13 are the only channels that can play PSG
        sounds and 14-15 the only that can generate noise. We will only be
        experimenting with PCM sounds.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm917"></a>Making the Sounds</h2></div></div></div><p>
        To play our sounds, we will use the unbelievebly impressive homebrew
        audtio library, maxmod. maxmod is distributed with libnds, so you
        should already have it installed. maxmod can play music as well as
        sound effects, in such formats as mod, it, s3m, xm, and wav, but we'll
        just be using it as a wav player to play our sound effects. For more
        information and deeper coverage of the library, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://maxmod.org/" target="_top">http://maxmod.org/</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm921"></a>Using the Sounds</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The makefile I've included with my manual has a custom rule for
        creating a <code class="filename">soundbank.bin</code> file from all audio files
        in the <code class="filename">audio</code> project folder. The rule runs mmutil
        to create the <code class="filename">soundbank.bin</code> and
        <code class="filename">soundbank.h</code> files. The bin2o rule turns the .bin
        file into something safe to link into your nds file and creates the
        <code class="filename">soundbank_bin.h</code> file. All of these header files
        will be located in the <code class="filename">build</code> folder after a build,
        if you wish to review their contents.

        Now it's finally time for some code. maxmod simplifies sound playing
        quite a bit. All we need to do is initialize the library, let it know
        where our soundbank is, load the sound from our soundbank, and call a
        function to play the sound. It will serve our purposes for now, as a
        springboard into more advanced forms of sound. Enough with the chatter,
        here's some code for our <code class="filename">main.cpp</code>.

    Programming the Nintendo DS, and other embedded hardware systems in
    general, requires knowledge of many different concepts the terms used to
    describe them. Throughout this manual, we've introduced many terms that you
    probably have never encountered, excepting that you might have had other
    embedded hardware or video game programming practice.
  </p><div class="glossdiv"><dl><dt><a id="irq_handler"></a><span class="glossterm">Interrupt Request Handler</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
          An interrupt handler is a function that is called after an interrupt
          is triggered. It is code designed to do something useful as a result
          of the interrupt. A common example of an interrupt handler is the
          VBlank interrupt handler. Upon entering VBlank, the Nintendo DS will
          cause the VBlank handler to run which will often update the graphics
          engines and/or VRAM to draw new images onto the display. The updating
          of the display is tied to the VBlank interrupt to avoid screen
          artifacts and to keep screen updating from the software side in sync
          with screen updatingon the hardware side.
